# IELTS Institute Training Platform

This is a full-stack web application built as an IELTS (International English Language Testing System) training platform. The application provides an online learning environment for students preparing for IELTS exams, featuring course materials, practice tests, AI-powered scoring, and expert guidance. The platform aims to help students achieve their target IELTS scores through comprehensive training modules and personalized feedback.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **PostgreSQL** database (optional - project includes in-memory storage for development)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sathish2434/IELTS-Institute.git
cd IELTS-Institute
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration (Optional)

For production or if you want to use a PostgreSQL database:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your database connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string_here"
```

**Note**: The project works without a database connection using in-memory storage for development.

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- Frontend development server at `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API server at `http://localhost:3000`

### 5. Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development servers (frontend + backend)
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run db:push` - Push database schema changes (if using PostgreSQL)

### 7. Development Workflow

1. The frontend runs on Vite with hot module replacement
2. The backend uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution
3. Changes to either frontend or backend will auto-reload
4. Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the application

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using **React 18** with **TypeScript** and follows a component-based architecture. Key design decisions include:

- **UI Framework**: Uses **shadcn/ui** components built on top of **Radix UI** primitives for accessible, customizable components
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** with CSS variables for theming, providing a warm, educational color palette (cream/beige backgrounds with olive green accents)
- **Routing**: **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: **TanStack Query** (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Form Handling**: **React Hook Form** with **Zod** validation for type-safe form management
- **Build Tool**: **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds

The component structure is organized into:

- `/components/ui/` - Reusable UI primitives
- `/components/` - Feature-specific components (navbar, hero, testimonials, etc.)
- `/pages/` - Route components
- `/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a **Node.js/Express** architecture with TypeScript:

- **Runtime**: **Node.js** with **ESM modules**
- **Framework**: **Express.js** for HTTP server and API routing
- **Database ORM**: **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL dialect for type-safe database operations
- **Build Process**: **esbuild** for production bundling
- **Development**: **tsx** for TypeScript execution in development

The server architecture includes:

- Centralized route registration system
- Storage abstraction layer with both in-memory and database implementations
- Middleware for request logging and error handling
- Vite integration for development mode

## Data Storage

The application uses a flexible storage architecture:

- **Primary Database**: **PostgreSQL** via **Neon Database** serverless connection
- **ORM**: **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions with **Zod** integration for validation
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing

Current schema includes user management with plans for expanding to course content, test results, and progress tracking.

## Authentication & Session Management

The system is prepared for session-based authentication:

- **Session Store**: **PostgreSQL** session storage via **connect-pg-simple**
- **Security**: Cookie-based sessions with secure configuration
- **User Management**: Basic user schema with username/password authentication ready for implementation

## Development & Deployment

The application is configured for both development and production environments:

- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite, TypeScript checking, and in-memory storage
- **Production**: Optimized builds with static asset serving and database connectivity
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate configurations for development and production modes

## Design System

The application implements a cohesive design system:

- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern, readable text
- **Color Scheme**: Warm, educational palette with cream backgrounds and olive green accents
- **Component Library**: Consistent component variants using **class-variance-authority**
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind's responsive utilities
- **Accessibility**: Built on Radix UI primitives ensuring WCAG compliance

# External Dependencies

- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript/TypeScript bundler for production

## Runtime Libraries

- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and data fetching
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management and validation
- **Zod**: Schema validation library
